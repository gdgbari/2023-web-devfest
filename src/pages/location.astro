        Bari's railway station (Bari Centrale) is directly connected with Turin,
        Rome, Genova and Milan. There are connections that you can reach with a
        high-speed train (Freccia Rossa). The train schedule is available at the
        site of Trenitalia. Recall that in Italy, before getting on the train,
        you must stamp your ticket by using those small yellow machines
        available within the station. To reach the venue, you can take the city
        bus number 21 and get off at the bus stop in via Re David (stop called
        Re David (Politecnico)). Here you can find the directions on Google maps. As an
        alternative, the University is at walking distance from the railway
        station (approximately 20-30 minutes).

        Bari is near the intersection of two highways: A14 Adriatica (Bologna -
        Taranto). Parking is a bit of a problem and most parking areas are with pay-meters. The
        nearest free parking to the venue is the Park & Ride LARGO 2 GIUGNO (8 minutes walk).

        Bari has an international airport with daily flights to London and
        Munich, as well as to Rome, Milan, and other important Italian cities.
        The timetable of incoming and outgoing flights is available at the site
        of Bari airport. The airport is approximately 27 km from the center. The
        most convenient way to reach the center is probably by metro. You can take 
        the Ferrotramviaria Bari, a city train that connects Bari Airport to Bari 
        Railway Station (Bari Centrale), then take the city bus number 21 and get 
        off at the bus stop in via Re David.
